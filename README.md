# My Portfolio WebsiteðŸ’­

This project is a website about myself and includes my contact details. It also includes a second page containing the projects I have completed so far. Please note, not all of the projects are included on GitHub just yet.
The projects which are currently linked to GitHub are:
* Website Design
* Sports Club Website

## Technologies
I applied HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this website. This includes responsive design.

I utilised JavaScript to create some interactivity between the website and user. The button on my page will reveal a random fact about myself each time the user clicks it.

Furthermore, I have included additional JavaScript code which is currently commented out. This was written to hide the nav bar menu options when in mobile view, but appears when it is hovered over and then disappears once the mouse exits the nav section.
The code works however, I noticed that when I change the view size to tablet or desktop, the style of the nav bar does not automatically revert to it's original style, the page has to be reloaded in order to achieve this. Hence why it is currently commented out, as I plan to revisit this once I have an improved understanding of using JavaScript with Media Queries.
